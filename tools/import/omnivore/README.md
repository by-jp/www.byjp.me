# Omnivore importer

This (even more shoddily built) script pulls my annotated articles in from Omnivore and turns them into bookmarks.

Annoyingly, Omnivore marks the "ReadAt" date as being the _most recent_ time you read it (not the first time), so my most-enjoyed articles will jump to the top when I re-read them. This isn't terrible, but I'll put a request in with them to avoid this!

I don't have a mechanism for running this regularly (and committing the results to the repo) but that'd be next!
