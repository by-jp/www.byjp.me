Thank you so much for sending a video! And the detail is great to know about too.\n\nI think I'll try to animate the card lifting up to flip next (so it doesn't sink through any table its on) ‚Äî and try to find a way to get my hands on a Vision Pro ????","author":{"name":"JP","url":"https://hachyderm.io/@byjp"},"timestamp":"2024-12-05T15:46:30Z"},{"guid":"webmentions.io#1865366","emoji":"üí¨","url":"https://techhub.social/@ellenich/113601011842803188","comment":"@byjp not 100% sure if it's controllable, but it also seemed like the default orientation was off by 90¬∫?

This is a screenshot from macOS QuickLook which implies it's the correct orientation, but there could easily be something I haven't configured. Thanks for sharing ‚Äî I'll keep reading up on USDZ!","author":{"name":"JP","url":"https://hachyderm.io/@byjp"},"timestamp":"2024-12-05T15:57:56Z"},{"guid":"webmentions.io#1865367","emoji":"üí¨","url":"https://hachyderm.io/@byjp/113601072249681596","comment":"@ellenich Out of interest, which side was \"up\" when you loaded it? It looks like it might have been the \"back\" (with the handwriting and address), where I put the model together expecting it to be the \"front\" (with TOLEDO). That might explain the 90¬∫ offset too (as the flip switches between landscape and portrait)","author":{"name":"JP","url":"https://hachyderm.io/@byjp"},"timestamp":"2024-12-05T16:06:38Z"},{"guid":"webmentions.io#1865372","emoji":"üí¨","url":"https://mastodon.social/@edwellbrook/113601164238859630","comment":"@byjp SO cool!!","author":{"name":"Ed","url":"https://mastodon.social/@edwellbrook"},"timestamp":"2024-12-05T16:30:02Z"},{"guid":"webmentions.io#1865373","emoji":"üí¨","url":"https://hachyderm.io/@byjp/113601191037341949","comment":"@edwellbrook It is!
