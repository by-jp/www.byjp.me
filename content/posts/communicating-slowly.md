I've built a microsite called [slow.fyi](https://slow.fyi). It is a single-purpose, small, and simple page designed to let people (myself very much included) let those I send messages to that receiving a reply would be _appreciated_ (rather than being expected).

Particularly now the stresses of our own lives are unpredictable, let alone those of our friends we're not regularly in touch with. I've been using "[slow.fyi](https://slow.fyi)", literally written like that on Signal/Whatsapp/email/etc., as a way to demonstrate a lack of pressure in long or short messages I've been sending to friends. Perhaps you'll find it useful too.
