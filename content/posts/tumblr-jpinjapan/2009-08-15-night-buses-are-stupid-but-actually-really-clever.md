You see, the big problem is that while the seats are amazingly comfy and recline with leg rests and so on, the buses are usually only 6 or 7 hours long and at least 2 hours of that is the small stops at th start and the end!

Having done two of these in a row I am so tired I can barely think, but we're in Osaka with an all day subway pass and all the outrageously touristy things to do before we meet up with our local friend tomorrow (do you remember Ai?). There's a zoo, an aquarium (JK tells me a massive proportion of the world's aquatic variety comes from Japan due to its warmer waters), the Baseball stadium (baseball is **massive** here) and of course the Osaka-jo, the castle.

We'll see how much we get done before we (I?) fall asleep on a bench! Arigatou Gozaimasu!
