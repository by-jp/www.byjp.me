Time to move away from Tokyo and so far quite tricky! We've chosen to travel to Hakone, a renowned beauty site for Japanese and foreign tourists alike. This is a bit of an issue as it's high tourism seasonâ€¦ In fact at this very moment we're in what appears to be a hotel/spa trying to find directions to the hostel we booked earlier in Odanawa station. The only problem is that it doesn't seem to exist! We're told it closed last year, I'm 90% sure the Japanese I used was to book a room, not to rebuild a hostel!
