Got the 12 hour flight blues,\
Half a day on a plane.\
Got the 12 hour flight blues,\
Will I ever see the ground again?!\
12 hour flight blues...

And they tell me it'll never land on time

James kindly points out it's only a 10 hour flight :P tried playing his piano at home to make a brief recording of the above tune, but it doesn't help that I can't play the piano!

Off to Heathrow now, until Japan!
