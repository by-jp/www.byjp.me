We had a little difficulty finding the capsule hotel we wanted (we were looking at the wrong map in our sleepless mess) so we stopped off in the Ritz for directions and a cigar. Okay, just directions. They had an adjoining Ferrari Showroom (doors directy to the front lobby!) but even the 20,000Â¥ we had didn't quite cover the undoubtedly multi-million Yen price ags!
