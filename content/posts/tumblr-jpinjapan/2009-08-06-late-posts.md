So you've probably noticed the last 4 posts or so just appeared in one go - we've been WiFi-free since we left Tokyo so I've been drafting my posts on my iPhone, so hopefully when I find some free WiFi they'll all pop up together. They should be in chronological order, with the newest at the top (as usual) It's also quite amusing that over the past 3 days the only free WiFi I've found has been *on* a bus. Unfortunately I found this out because the signal vanished as the bus pulled out of the station - it wasn't my bus :P
