summary: Archiving my Instagram account, and releasing the code that imported it to this Hugo-driven site.
---

I spent a little time this weekend reminding myself of what writing code is like (before I start work again on Tuesday, after [4 months travelling](https://adventure.awaits.us)). After my recent post on [leaving Meta's social networks](/posts/goodbye-big-social) I decided to create a script to convert the GDPR-provided archive of all my activity on Instagram into this blog.

You can find it at [/instagram-posts](/instagram-posts) â€” I'll figure out a good place to leave a permanent link soon!

If this incredibly specific challenge is something you also face, you can find the (slap-dash) code I wrote in the [repo that contains this blog](https://github.com/jphastings/www.byjp.me/tree/main/tools/archive/instagram).
