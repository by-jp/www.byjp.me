I spent a little time this weekend reminding myself of what writing code is like (before I start work again on Tuesday, after [4 months travelling](https://adventure.awaits.us)). After my recent post on [leaving Meta's social networks](/posts/goodbye-big-social) I decided to create a script to convert the GDPR-provided archive of all my activity on Instagram into this blog.

You can find it at [from-instagram](/tags/from-instagram) — ~~I'll figure out a good place to leave a permanent link soon!~~[^1].

{{< figure src="instgram-posts.webp" title="A screenshot of the new archival page on this blog; tiled photos from my instagram feed." >}}

If this incredibly specific challenge is something you also face, you can find the (slap-dash) code I wrote in the [repo that contains this blog](https://github.com/by-jp/www.byjp.me/tree/main/tools/archive/instagram).

[^1]: I switched to treating Instagram photos as a part of my [photos stream](/photos), but left the [from-instagram](/tags/from-instagram) tags on there, in case you want to find those specifically.
