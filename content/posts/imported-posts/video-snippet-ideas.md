Iâ€™ve set about trying to come up with some interesting ideas for some video snippets - flickr style, short and (dare I use the phrase?) â€˜artisticâ€™ type rather than YouTube style meme style stuff.

Why mention this now? Iâ€™m standing on Castle Boulevardâ€™s roundabout in Nottingham with my time lapser clicking regular shots of the midnight traffic. Now to do the maths to figure out how long I should leave it runningâ€¦

Would be cool to get one of those TI calculators that do BASIC programming so I can record clips with varying wait periods.
