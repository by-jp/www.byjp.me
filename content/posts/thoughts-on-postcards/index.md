I've long admired and played with [postcards](/tags/postcards). For me there's an art to every aspect of creating and sending them â€” designing, choosing, writing, drawing, doodling, stamping â€” each of which could stand books' worth of elaboration.

Art is, in my humble opinion, at its greatest when limitlessly exploring a limited space, and a postcard provides plenty of just this kind of freeing limitation. They can be heartfelt and genuine precisely _because_ they don't immediately invite a reply (unlike practically all other interpersonal communication), they invite novelty (like Mr. Bingo's hilarious [Hate Mail](https://mr.bingo/hate-mail-book/), or Lupi & Posavec's beautiful [Dear Data](http://www.dear-data.com/theproject)) _because_ they are so simple and (literally!) inflexible.

Even now I'm slowly building a microsite gallery for the postcards my friend Claire sends me whenever she travels, telling meâ€“often with helop from a new friendâ€”to "Shut up, JP" in the local tongue.

I think I'll always enjoy playing with postcards, in one form or another. If you'd ever like to tell me about your appreciation of them, a postcard you've enjoyed receiving do reach out by email! (I have a [standing invitation](/standing-invitation)) â€” and if you'd like to send me one you can do the same, and ask for my address.
