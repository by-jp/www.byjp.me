Hello friends, I miss you! I'm barely on the giant social media sites any more, which means I don't get to interact with so many of you in the ways I used to. It sucks.

So I have a proposition for you: if you're feeling a little creative, if you'd like to _be_ the change bringing more personality and creativity to the internet, then **I'll help you get there**.

I'll help you find your voice on the web ‚Äî maybe a hobby, your thoughts, photography, art or poetry; I'll help you build your site (sharing what I already know and learning more together); I'll buy you a birthday present's worth of tools that suit you; and I'll help you find others doing the same.

Leave the attention-seeking, profit-optimised, social media [slop](/bookmarks/slop-is-the-new-name-for-unwanted-ai-generated-content/) to wither and die ‚Äî come and bring your creativity and joy to the IndieWeb community!

## Inspiration & joy

Here are some favourites of mine; some intimidatingly impressive, some simple and expressive:

- This poetic ode to [soft tech](https://helena.mmm.page/soft-tech), and its [author Helena's creativity](https://hjaramillo.com/projects-20).
  - ‚Ä¶and [mmm.page](https://mmm.page), the gloriously expressive (free!) platform its made on.
- The beautiful [kinetic woodwork of David C. Roy](https://www.woodthatworks.com/) ‚Äî [this piece](https://www.woodthatworks.com/kinetic-sculptures/duality) in particular just mesmerises me.
- [Red Blob Games](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/) is [Amit Patel](https://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/) writing explaining the super geeky world of game development in a way that's really accessible and engaging.
- [Neocities](https://neocities.org/) is the spiritual successor of the 1990s' "GeoCities" site that made "having a website" a possibility for everyday people. _This_ is an internet of creativity and passion ‚Äî sometimes unfathomable, but always intriguing.
- [Low‚ÜêTech Magazine](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/), an online publication powered by a solar-powered computer ‚Äî¬†sometimes, often at night, it won't be available, and that's totally fine.
- This incredible interactive article on [the physics of how how bikes work](https://ciechanow.ski/bicycle/) (with many other similarly fantastic articles along side)
- [Jennifer Mills News](https://jennifermillsnews.tumblr.com/), a cute weekly one-page newspaper covering the everyday adventures of Jennifer Mills.
- [chia.earth](https://chia.earth/), a deconstruction of a calm landscape, represented in text, that you can explore and change.
- [neal.fun](https://neal.fun/), particularly the delightful [Internet Artifacts](https://neal.fun/internet-artifacts/), bringing the concept of an internet museum (about the internet to life.
- A good old [blogroll](https://blogroll.org/)! A list of interesting blogs you might like to visit.

I should stop there, or I'll never post this ‚Äî the internet is so full of hidden creativity and joy, I hope you'll be a part of that!
