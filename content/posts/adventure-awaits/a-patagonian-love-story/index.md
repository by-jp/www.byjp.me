A day or two before arriving in Patagonia I started looking at reviews of the “W” circuit hike that is one of the star attractions of the region. It’s a 70km hike with two 1km high viewpoints to reach, that we were planning to complete over 5 days (and 4 nights staying in well tended hostels, or _refugios_), so getting some advice from those before us seemed prudent at the least!

One review stood out to me: “Completing this trek was one of the best experiences of my life”, said Helen from Minnesota. As much as I do it myself, I do tend to roll my eyes at hyperbole — sure Torres del Paine is world-class beautiful, and I know how far people travel from around the world to walk the “W” and the “O” circuits, but… of a _life?_

{{< figure caption="This is the route we walked, from right to left. You can see why it's called the \"W\"! (I forgot to turn on the tracking for the first half hour of day 3!)" src="the-w-route.webp" >}}

Well, my Minnesotan friend, how right you were! Not only was every moment of the hike eye-wateringly beautiful but also, at the practically divine peak of _Mirador Base las Torres_, Yvette proposed to me! “Adventure awaits, mi amor”, the engraving in the compass said, as the needle swung to point directly at her, “and I would love you to be part of all my adventures to come… Will you marry me?”

Any of you who’ve hung out with us will know there was only ever going to be one answer to that question, but saying “yes” in such a majestic space was even more a privilege and joy.

That first day was beautiful even before the summit — neither the spitting rain (nor Yvette’s nerves, it seems) could stop our ear-to-ear grins. The final rock-scramble to the top was definitely a tricky one (my [IT-bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliotibial_tract) are still complaining), but that moment where the three towers rose above the eerie other-worldly terrain still glows within me.

With such a momentous first summit you might think that we barely noticed the rest of our 5 day hike, but Torres del Paine continued to show us its most beautiful side. The weather only improved and, on the second day alone, gave us bird-filled hikes along pebbly beaches, long (and very well maintained) rope and plank bridges across raging snowmelt rivers, and wonderful _refugios_ (hostel refuges) filled with surprisingly good food, reasonably priced beer, and the most lovely hikers from around the globe. (We learned a great Israeli card game called “Yaniv”, taught to us by new Dutch friends — the kind of combination you’ll only get while backpacking!)

Day three was a little more challenging for me, especially after my mistake of not stretching down on day 1 with all the celebrations! The 1km high _Mirador Británico_ (the British viewpoint, hilariously just a little higher up the path from the _Mirador Frances_) was rather daunting — that 1,042m climb, the rock-scrabble down, and the 8km onward hike put a very long day between us and our next ~~refugio~~ beer…

We made it most of the way to the _Mirador Frances_, but at the point my knees were causing stops every 5 minutes, Yvette—travelling on a French passport—proudly proclaimed that “this spot looks very French to me”, which was all the excuse I needed!

The journey to _Refugio Grey_, the last of our hiking pit-stops, was as beautiful as the refuge was comfortable. Whole hillsides of fuscia orchids, brazen _[Chimango Caracara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimango_caracara)_ and other wonderful wildlife preening just off the path, with the enormous glacier always poised at the end of the Lake Grey — it made the 30º sun and 65km/h winds _enjoyable_, not just worth tolerating!

Wow, I’ve rambled on almost longer than our hike! Suffice to say that you should immediately plan your trip to Patagonia’s beautiful _Torres del Paine_, it’s the hike of a lifetime _even if_ you don’t have a wonderful human craftily planning its next thrilling chapter.
