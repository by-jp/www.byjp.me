I've just finished my ninth-last day at work before our sabbatical begins. Nine isn't a special number, and nor was today unique except, for the first time, our travels are starting to feel *real*.

Maybe it was our weekend of fun with family, celebrating our 4th anniversary yesterday, or that the mountain of Things To Doâ„¢ has shrunk enough to let the light from our semi-nomadic future shine back into 2022 â€” whatever it is, something has clicked into place, and I can't stop grinning!

{{< figure title="We're crossing quite a lot of timezones." alt="A world map showing the planned flights from London to Cartagena, then Santiago de Chile, Patagonia, Rio in Brazil; a gap, then Lima in Peru to Vancouver, Canada, and finally Tokyo, Japan." src="the-plan.webp" >}}

Along with the excitement we're also working through some disappointing realisations, in particular that we're not likely to be able to visit Yvette's family in Venezuela. The [FCDO advises heavily against trips](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/venezuela), recommendations from friends in the country are cautious at best, and the USA's [prohibition of flights](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-airlines-idUSKCN1S733E) over Venezuela has even made finding ways into the country challenging. This is crushing for both of us; I'd love to see Christie again, and to meet so many of Yvette's family for the first time, but Venezuela's instability has kept Yvette away for the last eight years, and it's going to really suck being so close, and yet so far.

We're investigating the possibility of staying in Aruba during February and offering a space for Yvette's family to visit us there, which might work out depending on how quickly the [USA's recent U-turn](https://www.state.gov/joint-statement-on-venezuela-negotiations-2/) changes travel options. Yes, we've had [Kokomo](https://songwhip.com/the-beach-boys/kokomo) stuck in our heads and blasting from speakers for days.

Our trip's project management software is seeing a lot of use, we've taken full advantage of the recent sales to get lightweight backpacks, and friends have put us in touch with a lovely couple who are going to look after our flat while we're away too. There are 34 days remaining. As I said, it's starting to feel *real*!

Here's to the last few, important steps of our planning, to the last days of work, and to spending Christmas with our family and friends here in the UK before we set off!
