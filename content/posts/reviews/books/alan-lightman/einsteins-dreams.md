A wonderful series of glimpses of strange worlds where time is fundamentally different - an insight into the weird and wonderful worlds Einstein must have dreamt through in his Annus Mirabilis.

A friend commented recently that it'd be cool to read a companion book which explained the physics behind each of the worlds, and which parts of his theory of relativity was tweaked to produce each of the strange worlds, but for the non-technically inclined there's not a morsel of physics you'd need to read and love this book.
