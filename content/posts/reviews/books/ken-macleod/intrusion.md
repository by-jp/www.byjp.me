Back when I wrote Goodreads reviews, I tried to keep them short & sweet — which makes them seem a little out of place here on this blog!
{{%/ importnote %}}

A very well written book with a good combination of mystery, politics, scientific fact and deep characters. Occasionally the technical talk may be overwhelming (for me it was with the politics, but there's some chemistry, technology and a little law) but it's skilfully placed to not hand-hold those with technical knowledge while allowing those without the specific knowledge enough to follow the story.
