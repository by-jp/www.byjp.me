Back when I wrote Goodreads reviews, I tried to keep them short & sweet — which makes them seem a little out of place here on this blog!

Wonderful! The serialisation of this book was perfect for the story and I was always looking forward to Tuesday mornings when my Kindle would update with the latest edition.

I find myself looking for a sequel.
