Back when I wrote Goodreads reviews, I tried to keep them short & sweet â€” which makes them seem a little out of place here on this blog!

An interesting and gripping book with food for much deep thought on the nature of morality, but the "story over many generations" format has always left me feeling as though I've read a group of short stories, each with an unsatisfactory end.
