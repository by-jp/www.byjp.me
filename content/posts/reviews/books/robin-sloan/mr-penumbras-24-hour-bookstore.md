Back when I wrote Goodreads reviews, I tried to keep them short & sweet — which makes them seem a little out of place here on this blog!

This is a superb book. Inspiring, permanently thrilling, believable but without trying to be, witty and laugh-out-loud funny in places – I can't recommend it enough.
