On Saturday we went for day hike across [Surrey Hills](https://surreyhills.org/), from Ockley Station to Dorking, via the beautiful vistas of Leith Hill Tower. It was such a lovely hike!

Being just over an hour from Victoria Station in London made it easy to get to and back from within a day, and it gave us the opportunity to visit the highest point in South East England â€” all 304m of it ðŸ˜‚

Surrey Hills is an [Area of outstanding Natural Beauty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_of_Outstanding_Natural_Beauty)â€”one of the nearest to Londonâ€”and it's easy to see why. As the brief rainfall that welcomed us onto our hike faded away we came across Barn Cottage, with a helpful QR code carefully posted to a tree at its entrace. It pointed us to [a website](https://www.macspeedee.com/barncottage/) describing the history of this stunning OrnÃ© style "chocolate box" cottage, and the landscape before us.

The hike was easy most of the way, with a half an hour of noticeable incline, and 15 more minutes right before the tower that definitely let us know we were travelling vertically. Nothing as severe as the 2,100m two-day hike {{< friend "chris" >}} was taking on at the same time near Vancouver, but still very enjoyable â€” and a wonderful view for lunch!

We finished off our hike in Dorking. Sadly [Denbies Vineyard](https://www.denbies.co.uk/) closes at 5pm, so we missed out on a tour, but we did briefly visit the sunny Star Inn for a refreshing half, and then the charming [The King's Arms](https://www.kingsarmsdorking.co.uk/) for a tasty bite and another celebratory tipple.

All in all, an extremely good day!
