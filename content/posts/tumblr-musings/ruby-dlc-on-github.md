[github.com](https://github.com/jphastings/ruby-DLC)

Ruby-DLC is now available on github, and consequently as a gem! You can install with[^1]:

```sh
gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
sudo gem install jphastings-dlc
```

There‚Äôs a [gist](https://gist.github.com/jphastings/106978) explaining how to use the library and the rdoc documentation is still available on my [project page](https://github.com/jphastings/ruby-DLC). Please file an [issue](https://github.com/jphastings/ruby-DLC/issues) if you have any problems with the code, I haven‚Äôt checked it thoroughly!

[^1]: Import note: This syntax is incorrect today, and the code only supports Ruby 1.x, so you'll have to make your own way if you're interested in using this!
