I’ve started coding a native Ruby library for extracting RAR archives. Its in early stages, but I’ve placed down the code for parsing the file structure, so it can extract unencrypted, ‘store’ level archives.

The ultimate aim is to allow the streaming of files from archives and the progressive extraction of files from inside archives.
