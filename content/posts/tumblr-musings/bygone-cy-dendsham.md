[bygone](/poetry/bygone)[^1] by Cy Densham

I continue to write small chunks of poetry, under my pen name _Cyrus Densham_. I’ve not really had any literary training (wooh, English GCSE) so they really are just what I think sounds nice. Still, feel free to deconstruct and criticise, but they’re genuinely not written to impress anyone (isn’t that the point?).

[^1]: Import note: I've recovered my old poetry site from backups and stored it in this blog. This isn't Shakespeare, but I hope you like it!
