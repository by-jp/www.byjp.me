This was _exactly_ what I was looking for.

If you're investingating JSON returned from a web service, get the control you need with the terminal and [jsonpp](https://github.com/jmhodges/jsonpp):

```bash
brew install jsonpp
curl -u username:password https://awesome.com/stuff.json | jsonpp 
```

BOOM. As they say.
