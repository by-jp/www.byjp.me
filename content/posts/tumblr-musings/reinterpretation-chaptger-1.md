[Cy Densham](http://poetry.kedakai.co.uk/author:Densham/)[^1], my literary counterpart, is in the process of releasing a haiku in four parts.  This part, _Chapter I_, whilst not conforming to the traditional standard for haiku of 5,7,5 syllables it is in the same vein. Hopefully more will become apparent as the remaining chapters are released!

[^1]: Import note: I'm still working on resurrecting my poetry site. I'm really hoping I can complete it, these four chapters were very enjoyable to write.
