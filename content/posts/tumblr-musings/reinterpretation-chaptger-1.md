[Cy Densham](/poetry)[^1], my literary counterpart, is in the process of releasing a haiku in four parts.

This part, _[Chapter I](/poetry/chapter-i)_, whilst not conforming to the traditional standard for haiku of 5,7,5 syllables it is in the same vein. Hopefully more will become apparent as the remaining chapters are released!

[^1]: Import note: I've moved my poetry to this site â€” getting it all to look right is a task still in progressâ€¦
