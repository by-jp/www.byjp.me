I‚Äôve written a ruby `File` class extension - `File.trash( filename )` - which allows you to send files to the Trash or Recycle bin (depending on your OS).

Mac support is ready, Windows support is touch-and-go (read the [wiki](https://github.com/jphastings/trash/wiki) for more info) and its been so long since I used Linux (ahh, the [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/) days) I can‚Äôt remember how the bins work over there. Anyone want to help?
