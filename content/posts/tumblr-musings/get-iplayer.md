If you're a mac user, and like your BBC television (**and** have a tv license) then you may like [my options](https://gist.github.com/jphastings/144622) file from the awesome [get_iplayer](https://github.com/get-iplayer/get_iplayer). You'll need to be vaguely happy on the terminal, but with this options file you can grab BBC video and have it automatically thrown into iTunes. With the PVR facility of get_iplayer you can even have them added to your iTunes as they're aired!  There's some commenting on the options file so you'll hopefully be able to tailor it as you need and, with luck, I'll have subtitles working soon too!
