Yeah. I saw the Google car. And yes, I'm wearing my [awesome retro comedy t-shirt](https://www.thatawesomeshirt.com/shirt/2516/blow-me/)[^1]. Tho I have short hair, which looks very weird now...

[^1]: Import note: I had a link to bustedtees.com here, but they no-longer list it online. It was a green T-Shirt with a grey/yellow screenprint showing an Nintendo Entertainment System cartridge and the (80s bubble style) text saying "blow me.". There's no accounting for taste ðŸ˜…
