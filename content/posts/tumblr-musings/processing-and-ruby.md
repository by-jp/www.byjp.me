I got stuck into [processing](https://processing.org) this weekend - I’ve been meaning to try it out for some time, but I also found a fantastic little project called [ruby-processing](https://github.com/jashkenas/ruby-processing/wiki). Yes, its exactly what it sounds like geeks, its the visual control of the processing language, in Ruby!

I instantly set about making a cool little toy, and I’ve got something pretty nifty almost ready for a release. Using the [carnivore](https://wiki.github.com/jashkenas/ruby-processing/r-s-g.org/carnivore/) library to watch the internet traffic going through your computer, and the fabulous free [hostip.info](https://hostip.info), I plot the global locations of the other computers your computer is talking to, in real time!

I’m sure I’ll be tinkering with it for a while yet, but I thought I’d whet your appetites :D Watch this space!

Massive credit to the creators of Processing and Carnivore, but particularly to _jashkenas_ for creating ruby-processing and being so prompt [helping me out](https://href.li/?http://r-s-g.org/carnivore/forum/YaBB.pl?action=dereferer;url=http://processing.org/discourse/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1240099712/0;anch=1) with my problems building this little ditty. You may be interested in his ruby-processing demo “[A Face for Stephen Hawking](https://href.li/?http://ashkenas.com/codework/a_face_for_stephen_hawking.html)” - and to put a topical spin on this, its good to see [Dr. Hawking is in better health now](https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8008767.stm).
