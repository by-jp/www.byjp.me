I had some time to kill on a lazy summer's day and I noticed that splendid chap [Max](https://mxcl.dev/), had posed a question to the lazy web:

> Is there a tool for measuring profanity in code-bases? If not, can someone write it and call it "pottymouth"? Ta.

So I did.

If you know ruby then maybe to can help it be a little better, fork [the repo](https://github.com/jphastings/pottymouth) and see what you can do.
