![A web-based questionaire describing this project/poem, asking people their age, and what they think of the poetry.](questionaire.jpg)

In its final days now, [Project Prime](http://poetry.kedakai.co.uk/projectprime/)[^1] is my attempt at combining art, poetry and maths in a funky little collaborative weave.

Hopefully, the result will be a collection of people's opinions of my poetry in a dynamic visual formâ€¦ I'm still to be convinced that it'll work well though! I'll probably end the work this weekend, and work on producing the final pieceâ€¦ stay tuned.

[^1]: Import note: My poetry site still needs to be imported!
