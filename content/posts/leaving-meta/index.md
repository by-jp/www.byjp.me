I'm leaving Meta's platforms wherever I can. Soon that'll be Facebook and Instagram, and one day (I hope) WhatsApp too.

**tl;dr**: Pick any of these that work for you to contact me, or follow me: [This website](/), {{< social email >}}, {{< social signal >}}; {{< social bluesky >}}, {{< social mastodon >}}, {{< social pixelfed >}}, [RSS](/index.xml).

I doubt anyone will be particularly surprised I'm deleting Facebook & Insta, I've barely been active on these sites for years and even failed a [promise to leave before](/posts/goodbye-big-social/), but this time feels different. This post serves as their tombstone for me.

## How to keep in touch?

One thing I've missed even _within_ these platforms for a few years now is actually being able to _follow along with my friends' lives_ (that's you!) instead of getting lost in adverts. Even though I'm trying to be more intentional about reaching out to people, I still miss chatting with so many of you, and that sucks.

So, if you want to **contact me for a chat** instead, you can always send me a message on {{< social signal >}}, or a good old {{< social email >}}.

And if you'd rather **follow my world passively**, you can too! This site is the core of anything I post online now, but everything gets copied elsewhere to make it easy for you. **Photos** go to {{< social bluesky >}} and {{< social pixelfed >}}, **"tweets"** go to {{< social mastodon >}} and {{< social bluesky >}}, **articles** go to all three.)

(If you know what [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) is then you probably already know there are feeds everywhere here, including a ['podcast' of sorts](/podcast), for posts with recordings.)

## Why are you leaving Meta?

I'm at a bit of a loss as to what to say here. I hope it's telling enough that I'm cautious of explaining _why_ I'm leaving Meta in a publicly accessible place? If you'd like to chat about it, just get in touch! Perhaps we can even go for a bite or a drink too.
