Here I am, two weeks into 2025, and I've reached the _Quality Street Watershed_. I've nibbled my way through all the "good" ones, those remaining after we were given one at our Christmassy gathering, and now each colourful chocolate I unwrap is just the _slightest_ bit disappointing.

Naturally there is a pecking (scoffing?) order to these treats, and I decided to rank them as I worked my way through:

| Name (Count[^1])                     | Notes                                                                                                        |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Orange Chocolate Crunch**&nbsp;(5) | The undeniable best. These were gone before I blinked.                                                       |
| **The Green Triangle**&nbsp;(4)      | Hazelnutty deliciousness. Yes please.                                                                        |
| **The Purple One**&nbsp;(6)          | Surprised me with tastiness. I'd normally leave these lower down the list!                                   |
| **Milk Chocolate Block**&nbsp;(4)    | Solid chocolatey punch. Dependable. Probably in the mid-highs on everyone's list.                            |
| **Caramel Swirl**&nbsp;(8)           | I prefer my chocs with a bit of a bite, so the caramel innards lower this a little, but still delicious.     |
|                                      |                                                                                                              |
| **Orange Creme**&nbsp;(7)            | Just a little too intense to be good enough for the faves. You could probaby twist my arm though.            |
| **Fudge**&nbsp;(6)                   | So plain. So dry‽ Meh incarnate.                                                                             |
| **Coconut Eclair**&nbsp;(7)          | Coconut shouldn't exist in chocolate form. I'm looking at you too Bounty. But at least it's still chocolate. |
| **Toffee Penny**&nbsp;(6)            | IT'S IN MY TEETH.                                                                                            |
| **Toffee Finger**&nbsp;(6)           | Chewy in summer, but rock hard an impenetrable in their native time of year. Or maybe I                      |
| **Strawberry Delight**&nbsp;(7)      | I refuse to accept that anyone finds these tasty. _NOPE._                                                    |

That gap in the middle? That's the watershed. Once I've eaten down the list that far I know that the holiday season is truly over, and it's time to embrace the new year.

Though I didn't count what came in _this_ tin[^1], I'm also cynically unsurprised that my "worth eating" chocs are only 5 of the 11 types[^2], and make up even less by count at just 40% of the tin! Here's to having friends with different tastes & sharing with them 😅

[^1]: I didn't count mine — they were a gift during a house party we were throwing and it seemed… perhaps a _tad_ antisocial to count them right then, or to forbid anyone from eating them that night 😅 These counts are from [the first search result](https://www.gazettelive.co.uk/whats-on/counted-every-chocolate-quality-street-30527339) that claimed to have counted them this winter.
[^2]: Yes, the post's title is also a 5 letter anagram of the 11 unique letters in "quality street". So "clever" is this reference that I have to explain it. In detail.
