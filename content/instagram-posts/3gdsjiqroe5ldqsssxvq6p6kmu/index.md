InMemory™

[#postcardsforlucy](/tags/postcardsforlucy)



No-one uses InMemory™ headsets any more. It was always clear they'd seriously mess with your mind, but the thought of being able to relive your favourite memories — actually be there, as if now was then — is mighty tempting.



To feel your first kiss — with all the unfamiliarity and excitement of youth; to re-experience your first standing ovation — aged 6 with a "speaking part" in the school play; so many wonderful things, lost in the busyness of our day-to-day lives, brought back more vivid than reality. They pitched it as a holiday.



But, of course, there was a catch. It's the first memory you touch upon that you relive, even if its something you'd rather forget. We're left, thirsting for escapism, held hostage by our own pasts.
