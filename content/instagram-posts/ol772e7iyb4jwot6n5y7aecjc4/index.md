I love the glorious nerdiness of my friends\! It's Matt's birthday \(on the left\) and we did Physics at Oxford together so, because he's not a fan of his birthday, he brought the Oxford Physics entrance exam for this "anti-fun day" 😂

Joke's on him, it's actually surprisingly fun to see how much can be remembered after more than a decade\!



PS. Jenny isn't cheating, honest 😁
