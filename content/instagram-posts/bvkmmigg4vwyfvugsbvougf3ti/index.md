I’ve not posted in a while cos travelling has been AMAZING, but one thing in particular has been outrageously awesome…

At the top of an incredible hike Yvette gave me a gorgeous engraved compass, and asked me to marry her 😍 Nothing in the world would make me happier—so, once we’re home from our adventures, we’ll be planning our wedding\!

If you care for more detail \(about Yvette’s proposal or our trip\!\) check out my bio for our adventuring blog ☺️

Yo te amo mucho mi amor\!
