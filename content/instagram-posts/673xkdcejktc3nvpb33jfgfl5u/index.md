Wandered into a comic store on a whim, being on holiday as I am, and asked for recommendations in the realm of one of my \(and every one else's\) favourites: Transmetropolitan, and it's loveable arsehole of a protagonist Spider Jerusalem.



Some chatter, recommendations and a delightful chat later I make my way out with a new purchase; the owner of the store  leaves me with this thought: "You know, we could do with a Spider Jerusalem right now". He's not wrong; Spider holds *everyone* to ruthless account, himself very much included.



Get you a copy of the first book, it's outstanding \(and features some of the greatest insults in modern writing\)
