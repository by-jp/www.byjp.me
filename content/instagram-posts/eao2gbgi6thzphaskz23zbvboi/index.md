My new friend Ed sings in the "Live Band Karaoke" at Copper Blues, the awesome bar I got to spend my last night in the US at\! Maybe I should have had one less drink, my flights have been a little testing ðŸ˜…



I've really enjoyed having deep and fascinating chats with strangers while I've been out here; I've met a theoretical physics researcher at ASU, a drone light show project manager, a travel-loving retiree who volunteers at Stanford University's Arizonan Gardens, and a host of others â€” this country feels super large to me, but the people I've met have been incredibly welcoming and open minded, I'll be coming back soon\!
