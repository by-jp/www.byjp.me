In lovely, nostalgic web 1.0 style, here are some links to the websites of friends of mine. Please enjoy, and get in touch with them if you like what they've built!

## Family

## Friends

* {{< friend av >}} â€” a superlative senior staff engineer at Deliveroo with me, exploring front-end technologies outside of our work remit.
