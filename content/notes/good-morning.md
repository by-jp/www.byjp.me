What a beautiful quote from {{< book "9781786699602" false >}}:

> \[…] greeting even our dearest with abbreviations like ‘Good morning’ when the true thought in our breast is ‘Every day you step into my life, you make it brighter, and if you left the world, something in me would starve for you forever, as when some barrier rises to shade a plant, which still has light enough to grow some but will never again taste the unbroken sun.’
