ðŸ˜­ Well shit. Looks like [Omnivore](/tags/omnivore) is being dropped as a service. (And soon) https://blog.omnivore.app/p/omnivore-is-joining-elevenlabs

They'll leave the source open & available, but it's not well set up for [selfhosting](/tags/selfhosting). I use the app _all the time_ and I've no idea what'll happen to that either.

I'm happy for them, they've built something great & been rewarded for it, but very sad for the loss of this wonderful reading tool.
