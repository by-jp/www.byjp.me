First [devlog](/tags/devlog)! Today I made a few first plans into a full restart of my postcards CLI tool & its fileformat. Together they make archiving & displaying [postcards](/tags/postcards) easy and fun!

My existing tool is great, but the `.postcard` format is too clever â€” it needs custom elements/JS for proper viewing. A newer experiment (https://shutup.jp) uses a simpler, more compatible & easier format; time to swap out!
