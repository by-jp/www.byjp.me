I'm dreaming of a bring-your-own "cloud" hosting company.

Imagine Vercel/Netlify let you put an SD card in a [RPi](/tags/rpi) on your home network. It'd open a tunnel out, run your app(s), and serve to the world.

It'd need some smart/simple isolation from the local network (security!), but I'd love how it'd allow trivial & cheap local hosting.
