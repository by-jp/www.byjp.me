Would your service use/pay for an [AltText](/tags/alttext) service that searched for existing alt text for your image (assuming it was a reposted image, and it respected copy rights)?

I'm thinking perceptual hash to Alt Text key-value store; could make a big jump for metrics like https://altometer.atdev.pro/ but would need some funding to check "all images" for phash & alt text.
