[@ncameron](https://twitter.com/ncameron) [@jonnyburch](https://twitter.com/jonnyburch) [@tommypalm](https://twitter.com/tommypalm) Having to implement the `flipper_id` method on everything you want to use as an "actor" was an important step to get right, but after that it's all pretty simple. Doesn't do any experimentation stuff though. If yous are ever keen to meal/beer to chat through this stuff, just 🌊😁
