Ink: best film I can remember seeing. Period. Don't read reviews or wait. D/L NOW[^1] & give all you can [doubleedgefilms.com/](https://doubleedgefilms.com/collections/ink)

[^1]: This film went down an unusual route of being freely downloadable on BitTorrent and other file-sharing methods of the time, and using the publicity of that to encourage people to buy the DVD (which I did!) I loved the a-capitalist approach to sharing it, as well as the film.
