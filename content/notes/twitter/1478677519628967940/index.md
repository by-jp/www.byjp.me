It's been a long while \(it's a big book, with bigger thoughts\) but today I finished reading [@Ada_Palmer](/twitter/#/Ada_Palmer)'s Perhaps the Stars, and so the chronicle that is Terra Ignota. Ada, your skill with language &amp; thought is unsurpassed; your story will never leave me. Thank you\! ðŸ’š
