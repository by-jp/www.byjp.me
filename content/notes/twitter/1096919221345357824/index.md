The perceptual hash algo \([https://github.com/Nr90/imgsim](https://github.com/Nr90/imgsim)\) wasn't perfect for my use case, but it did a pretty great job. They're a way of comparing the visual similarity of two images, where slight visual differences register as smaller numerical difference. {{< imgorvid src="media-1.mp4" >}}
