This eve, I'll &amp; frustrated by the shit IT systems NHS staff have to put up with, I decided to do another [art](/tags/art).\
\
I took a canvas \(traditional start\)\
Some crayons \(how old are you?\)\
And a hairdryer \(uh oh…\)\
\
And tamed gravity and Brownian motion enough to make this weirdness 😁🌈
