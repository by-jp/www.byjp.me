AudioBoo: Lonely Phone Shops

{{% audio src="audioboo-39482.mp3" %}}
Why is it that you always find phone shops in groups?

Are they particularly sociable shops?

Do they get a bit lonely?

I don't know.

Or is it that they just realise that no one ever knows what damn company they've actually got their contract with so they all put themselves in the same place so that if you get the wrong one you can always find the right one?

I don't know.
