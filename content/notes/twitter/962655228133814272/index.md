[@stevesmith2609](https://twitter.com/stevesmith2609) â€¦\(like one of John Scalzi's Old Man's War books, which I read one chapter of every Tuesday as it was released by Amazon\) will usually be written well in advance and only _released_ in episodes. Nothing to stop _new_ story telling media following what people like though\! /3
