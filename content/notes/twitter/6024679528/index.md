[e-603.com/E-603/TORNUP.html](https://web.archive.org/web/20180510220039/https://www.tornup.net/)[^1] I'd totally pay $200 if I had it

[^1]: This was a page to buy the (fantastic hip-hop mashup) album "TORN UP" by E-603, but the artist seems to have totally disappeared off the web! This album is still available on the Internet Archive, and on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/duncan-wierengo/sets/e-603-torn-up), but I can't find anywhere current to purchase it.
