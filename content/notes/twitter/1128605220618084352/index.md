[@ncameron](/twitter/#/ncameron) [@jonnyburch](/twitter/#/jonnyburch) [@tommypalm](/twitter/#/tommypalm) We used Split in ruby for a long time for experimentation \(the centralised DB eventually meant we had to leave that, as we left our monolith\), but there's deep similarity between features, experiments &amp; so on.
