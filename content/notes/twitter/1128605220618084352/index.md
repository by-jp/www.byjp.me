[@ncameron](https://twitter.com/ncameron) [@jonnyburch](https://twitter.com/jonnyburch) [@tommypalm](https://twitter.com/tommypalm) We used Split in ruby for a long time for experimentation \(the centralised DB eventually meant we had to leave that, as we left our monolith\), but there's deep similarity between features, experiments &amp; so on.
