Are any of you familiar with “Pebs”, the signifier of mutual benefit in a community from Becky Chambers’ “A Prayer for the Crown-Shy”?

I’m right at the start of the [book](/tags/book) but I *love* this concept. You gain a service/object and you give a number of Pebs that represents their value to *you*. It’s not monetary, it’s a note of appreciation that helps understand community health.

There’s no reserve, and you invent the Pebs as you give them (only recording a debit against yourself as you do) — so what’s the second anchor value for the scale? 1000 is “solved life-level crisis” or “gave life-level joy”?
