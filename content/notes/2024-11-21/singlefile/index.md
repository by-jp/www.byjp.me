The browser extension [SingleFile](https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile) is blowing my mind.

Not only will it create a minified, single-file copy of the webpage you're viewing that you can keep forever, it can also combines the parts in such a way that it can be read as a ZIP (with all the HTML, CSS, image & other files inside) _at the same time_ as being readable by browsers as HTML (which extracts that zip and displays the page) _at the same time_ as being a PNG file screenshot of itself. [Capture of my site's homepage here](byjp.u.zip.html).

Chapeau.
