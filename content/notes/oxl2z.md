I _think_ I've finally managed to run [IndieKit](https://getindiekit.com/) on my #homelab so that I can update my personal site from [MicroPub](/tags/micropub) clients (I'm trying [micro.blog](https://help.micro.blog/t/micro-blog-for-mac/45) on mac os right now).

It's more complex than I'd like, but perhaps I can invest some time into making the install process easier for others!
