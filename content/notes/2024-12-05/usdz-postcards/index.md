I'm mildly obsessed with postcards. I spent a slow day extending my tools for digitising them & now it makes 3D models that flip (the right way) when you tap them ðŸ¤©

It uses the USDZ format (so only support on Apple systems natively). Check out [this 115 year old postcard](./toledo.usdz) from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_postcards_in_the_United_States#Golden_age_of_postcards).
