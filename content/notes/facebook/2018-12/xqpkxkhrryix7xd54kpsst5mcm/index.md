I just watched Nanette.
You should watch Nanette.
It will feel awkward in parts, you will laugh, but you will also feel things that are hard to feel: don't stop.
This is one of the most masterfully told stories I have heard; the content, the phrasing, the structure and form. Hannah is artful, she is open, and I love her for it: please let me share her story with you.
