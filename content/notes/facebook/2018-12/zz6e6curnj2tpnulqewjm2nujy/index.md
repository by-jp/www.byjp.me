The "Age Verification" scheme that is being planned for launch in March to prevent some percentage of children from being able to access porn online will, in its current form, dramatically increase the likelihood of our sexual preferences being monetised, commodetised, and leaked.

For those interested in the details my friend and colleague Alec has written an excellent & in-depth analysis of the current legislation (https://medium.com/@alecmuffett/how-do-you-get-a-good-security-standard-really-not-like-this-d420319983ed ) â€” I intend to write to my MP referencing it.

For those of you who access porn online, or have friends who do: if the state of this legislation does not improve I will not be proving my age with services that implement it, and I would urge you to refuse similarly.

Should the time arrive, I'll be investigating safe ways to find ethical porn with my friends in the sex and software industries, and will be sure let you know!
