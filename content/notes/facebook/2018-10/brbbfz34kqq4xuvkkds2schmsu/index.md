A civil rights activist posted on twitter asking women what they'd do if their evenings were free from the tyranny of male strangers. The ensuing threads are eye opening and well worth a read, but they seem US-centric and I'm wondering how much applies here (UK/Europe). So I ask:

What are you, human of any variety, prevented from doing only because you don't feel safe from others?

(Please feel free to message me if you'd rather not post here)
