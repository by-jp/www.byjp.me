I've started listening to an album a day; I've been reconnecting with my youth a bunch of late (getting older will do that), so today's is _Kelis: Kaleidoscope_.

The emotion in _Caught Out There_ is so visceral for me, even now (it was a song that appeared in my childhood kitchen soon after what I now learn was my Mum finding out about my Dad's infidelity).
