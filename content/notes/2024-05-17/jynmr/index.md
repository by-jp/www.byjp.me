My friend and his hundred year old cũcũ (granny) are #crowdfunding to build a cultural archive of the language and stories from their family home in Embu, #Kenya. They're also helping fund the tenth episode of an animated children's show exploring African nursery rhymes!

Dig deep folks, the future will be poorer without stories from everywhere!
