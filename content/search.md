I quite enjoy this site _not_ having search, as it means folks need to explore it to find what's there — curiosity being something I'd love to inspire in people. Having said that, I do find myself in need of finding things I _know_ are in here, but which I can't put my finger on…

Sigh, it's time for search; but I'm sneaking this away where it's not too visible, so you'll have to have previously found this to know you can put `/search` into your browser to use it 😉
