title: From Gowalla

[Gowalla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gowalla) was a late 2000s location tagging/check-in tool, similar to Foursquare, for telling your friends what you were up to. Apparently I used it a lot!

In 2011 it was acquired by Facebook, and by mid-2012 all the site had been d=taken down, and the checkin data was either deleted or made unavailable to customers â€” so I don't have many of the photos associated with these posts, which is a shame.
