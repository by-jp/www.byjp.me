More and more I get the feeling that we, as a species, will be (poorly) debating the rights of non-human sentience from the animal kingdom well before we get anywhere near general "AI".

### Highlights

> A small-bird species, the Japanese tit (Parus minor), uses wing movements as a gesture to convey the message “after you,” according to new research at the University of Tokyo. When a mating pair arrives at their nest box with food, they will wait outside on perches. One will then often flutter its wings toward the other, apparently indicating for the latter to enter first. The researchers say that this discovery challenges the previous belief that gestural communication is prominent only in humans and great apes, significantly advancing our understanding of visual communication in birds.
