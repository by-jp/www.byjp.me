    name: The home as a place of production
    summary: Diverse work and the joy of making
    author: Karen Rosenkranz

Bringing more creation into our homes as a way to feel connected to our surroundings and communities. I couldn't appreciate this article more!

### Highlights

> Connectivity and the distraction it enables should be contained.

---

> Everything is optimised for convenience, comfort and safety for the consumer (and surveillance/value extraction for the corporations providing it).
> 
> This vision doesn’t sound very smart to me. Not only is it incredibly dull, it’s also totally disempowering.

---

> turning the home into a place of production again (and I don’t mean productivity!).

---

> This home of the future is one of reduced complexity, a place filled with fewer things, but things we know how to care for and repair.

---

> Part of the appeal of leaving the city is the potential to create homes (and lives) that allow for a greater diversity of activities.

---

> As AI-generated content becomes ubiquitous, ‘made by humans’ will become a quality trademark.

It'll be interesting to see whether "made by humans" is used as a pro-positive selling point, or whether "made without AI" is used as an anti-negative one. Currently I'm seeing more of the second (eg. [Not by AI](https://notbyai.fyi/))

---

> Everything we can do to loosen the grip of consumer capitalism on our lives helps us reclaim a bit of autonomy.

---

> These endeavours become even more empowering if they’re done in community.

---

> Let’s start here. Let’s replace personal comfort, convenience and safety with communal vitality, pleasure and agency.
