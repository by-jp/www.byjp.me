This research team has built a method of reducing a Gameboy ROM to only the subset of its data needed to play a certain recorded section of a mini-playthrough.

This means you can insert a _playable_ of a game into your site, without encroaching on copyright! Plus you can upload the (same) ROM and continue playing from that point in the game too. This is extremely cool!

Future games could consider how to (non-trivially!) design their codebases to make this easier. You’d get a lot of free marketing that’s for sure!
