As ever, a great read from DynoMight! I particularly enjoy the assertion on the burden of proof being on the expert to show the flaw in a simpler proof (that disagrees?) with their own more complex one.

### Highlights

> If two people disagree, it should be the responsibility Dr. Fancy to explain what’s wrong with Dr. Simple, not the reverse.

> “_onus probandi incumbit Bob_”?

“The burden of proof is on Bob”
