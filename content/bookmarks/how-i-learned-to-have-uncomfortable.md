Learn to have difficult conversations (increase your assertiveness quotient, or AQ) and, combined with solid emotional intelligence (EQ), you've a winning combination that avoids both "asshole" _and_ "people pleaser".

An interesting framing that resonates with me — I don't _think_ I'm an asshole (I believe I have pretty solid EQ), I think I'm good at asking for what I want (pretty solid AQ; assuming I _know_ what I want), and I've managed to gain respect in most of the places I spend time.
