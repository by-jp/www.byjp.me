I’m painfully aware that I’m now beyond the 35 year old cutoff that Douglas Adams pointed out[^1] makes me see new things as “against the natural order of things”, but I can’t help but connect with this article that so heartbreakingly accurately depicts the experience of using the internet today (compared to my first experiences in the 90s).

I think, in a very real way, those chances are a normal part of something fuelled initially by passionate people becoming mainstream; but also its clear that the internet continues to be strip-mined as a potential source of business growth, and squeezed for every possible advertising penny.

I like my little corner of the web, untouched by [slop](/bookmarks/slop-is-the-new-name-for-unwanted-ai-generated-content) or ads; but I wish this was something my non-tech friends could engage with, in the way that everyone with something they wanted to say had a geocities account back in the late 90s — techie or not!

      > 1. Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.
      > 2. Anything that's invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.
      > 3. Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things.
