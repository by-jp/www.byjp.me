    name: 'The Tilted Political Compass, Part 1: Left and Right'
    summary: I'm not a fan of the popular Political Compass. Here I explain why, list
      what makes a good 2-by-2 and rederive the meaning of the political left and
      right. Read more (10 min, 3300 words).
summary: I _really_ like the framing of this political compass & how it provides more
  insight into where people exist on it.

I _really_ like the framing of this political compass & how it provides more insight into where people exist on it.

I can absolutely see the survive/thrive alignment (referenced here from Scott Alexander’s linked article), and why it’s _totally reasonable_ to be at either end of that spectrum. I can similarly see why someone’s desire to have their obligations to the world be limited (a decoupled view) or be necessarily unlimited (a coupled view) fits very well indeed with the left/right divides I see in friends and family.

I’m intrigued by what the two unexplored quadrants would be; “coupled, surviving” and “decoupled, thriving” — I have a hunch that’s in part two.

### Highlights

> Stanovich talks about “cognitive decoupling”, the ability to block out context and experiential knowledge and just follow formal rules, as a main component of both performance on intelligence tests and performance on the cognitive bias tests that correlate with intelligence. Cognitive decoupling is the opposite of holistic thinking. It’s the ability to separate, to view things in the abstract, to play devil’s advocate.

---

> While science and engineering disciplines (and analytic philosophy) are populated by people with a knack for decoupling who learn to take this norm for granted, other intellectual disciplines are not.

---

> Novelists, poets, artists and other storytellers like journalists, politicians and PR people rely on thick, rich and ambiguous meanings, associations, implications and allusions to evoke feelings, impressions and ideas in their audience.

---

> At its most general it just means looking at a single issue/question/idea/fact at a time. Related ideas, implications and associations etc. can only be brought in explicitly and with the consent of all parties.

Wow; it’s alarming how seen I feel here 😅

---

> Contextualizing, on the other hand, means that all associative connections between ideas are valid and count as relevant if any party thinks they are.

---

> Political decouplers like money and the market as institutions because they quantify and decontextualize social obligations.

---

> coupled society what it means to be a good person or what may be required of you at any point is open-ended. There are not clear boundaries between people and you are expected to take others’ or society’s interests into account as much as your own.

---

> My hypothesis is that rightism is what happens when you’re optimizing for surviving an unsafe environment, leftism is what happens when you’re optimized for thriving in a safe environment.

Very, very much agree with this.

---

> Then the makers and the things made turned alike into commodities, and the motion of society turned into a kind of zombie dance, a grim cavorting whirl in which objects and people blurred together till the objects were half alive and the people were half dead.

---

> economic relations are stripped of their social elements, of feelings, intentions, meaning and will, turning it all into a machine. It _needs_ to be machine. Machines _work_. But it will never feel quite right for most of us.
