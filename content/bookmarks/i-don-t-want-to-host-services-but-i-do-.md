    name: I don't want to host services (but I do)
    summary: 'I don’t want to self-host, and even worse: I think most individuals
      shouldn’t host services for others. Yet, I am self-hosting services and I even
      teach people how to do it.'

A concise and smart article talking to those of us interested in offering hobby networked services to others.

I’m still in the mindset that a form of fully decentralised systems could overcome many of the issues mentioned here. My current bet would be on client-side web applications (or just websites) served from content addressed stores (like §IPFS), storing data primarily on local machines (think [fission.codes](https://fission.codes) and the §LocalFirst movement),  is going to be a fruitful route.

I’ll be looking forward to the next article on the challenges with end-to-end encryption (E2EE)!

### Highlights

> Good backups are:
> 
> * done regularly
> * documented
> * tested regularly
> * stored at a different location than the computer powering your services, also called [off-site backups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backup#Off-site%5Fdata%5Fprotection)
> * not accessible from a compromised machine in your network

---

> My recommendation to most people putting services online would be: either do it for yourself _only_, or do it as a team with proper structure and processes.

---

> we need to figure out how to do decentralise services and data storage for individuals _at scale_
