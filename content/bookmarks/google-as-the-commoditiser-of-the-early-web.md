An interesting take on why the internet can feel soulless, and some implied ways to counter that.

Slightly strong on the “back in the good old days” vibes, but a valid critique of search engines as a remover of mystery. Taking things for granted (“the advert to any question is at my finger tips”) has definitely removed the humanness of information for me.

### Highlights

> **Google popularized the habit of taking things out of context**

---

> Google eliminated the need to connect with communities online if all you wanted was the knowledge produced by that community.

---

> We now assume it is an established truth that the internet is made of “information” or “content”. This has not always been the case.
