A superb read, especially for me as I look for more depth in life. I keep finding myself coming back to this thought:

> There are many forces preventing us from feeling abstractly and confusingly and deeply, and from producing things that help others feel so.

I think I've certainly trained myself for a frictionless life, and have (up until the last few years) tended to avoid difficult thoughts â€” but I feel so much richer for embracing them!
