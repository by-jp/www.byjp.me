A curious person implements a chess program in an unlikely place: on your printer.

I’m always slightly blown away by people who build something because they want to explore and “why not”, rather than for any particular utility. This project is no exception!

It’s been a while since I files this link away for future me to read, and I now conveniently have a printer to be able to try it on, so I’ll definitely be reading the follow up post and trying it out if I can!
