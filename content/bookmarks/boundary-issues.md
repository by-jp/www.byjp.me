An extremely interesting article that helped me realise how different my definition of what “boundaries” are seems to differ from what contemporary usage is!

For me, a personal boundary is a pre-negotiated _promise_, not a _demand_. “These things hurt me, so if you end up doing them/I end up in that position (irrespective of intent or blame) then I will probably take these actions to protect myself.”

Instead of a tool of control (“you’ve crossed my boundary, you bad person”) it’s a tool for self-compassion (“I’ve reached my threshold and I need to care for myself for a spell. Here are some ways you could help with that, if you like.”)
