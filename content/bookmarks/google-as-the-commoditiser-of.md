A really interesting take on why the internet can feel soulless, and some implied ways to counter that.

Highlights:

> Google popularized the habit of taking things out of context.

> Google eliminated the need to connect with communities online if all you wanted was the knowledge produced by that community.

> We now assume it is an established truth that the internet is made of “information” or “content”. This has not always been the case.
