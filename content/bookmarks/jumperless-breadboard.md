I spend a good few days every couple of months building an electronics project of one variety or another, so I have _a lot_ of breadboard, veroboard, microcontroller boards, and ICs that do word and wonderful things floating about the place.

I have never seen anything **so awesome** as the Jumperless “breadboard”.

This thing has sockets like a normal breadboard, but you can hook any hole to any hole _in software_ over a serial connection. `1-2, 5-6, SUPPLY_5V-8,` will connect row 1 to row 2, row 5 to 6, and the 5V supply to row 8.

Its all done in analogue (with ~ 85Ω resistance, which is apparently not a problem for almost any breadboard circuit), and **there are LEDs beneath every row**, so you can visualise your circuits, should you need to‽

The returns policy is utterly superb too:

> If you don't love it for whatever reason, I accept returns indefinitely, even if you got a kit and built it yourself, or sawed it in half and lit both halves on fire. Just send it back and I'll issue a full refund.

If I weren’t on a career break with cash only flowing out I would be thinking very hard about buying this, it’s incredible!
