Recently, getting into the works of [Susan Sontag](https://www.philosophizethis.org/podcast/episode-176-susan-sontag), I realised I don't want to "review" things, and distance myself from them as I judge them. I want to explore _how_ they trigger meaning and excitement for me. These posts follow my journey on reflecting on the things I experience.
