## Asterisk Magazine

I love the design of [this magazine](https://asteriskmag.com/), the simple colours & design (as well as their ethos), but one little feature particularly is super intriguing!

On [any article page](https://asteriskmag.com/articles), if you highlight a block of text, an asterisk will appear which will let you bookmark that chunk of text — _entirely locally_. It stores the data in your browser's DB, so there's no data going back to the magazine about what the most highlighted section is, which is always nice.

I haven't explored this feature a lot, but I'd be interested in exploring whether the highlights can survive edits of the article? What referencing mechanism they use for storing the locations of the highlights? (Is it a [CFI](https://idpf.org/epub/linking/cfi/epub-cfi.html)?) Can you manually export your highlights later, in a format that allows for citations? It's all quitr exciting.
