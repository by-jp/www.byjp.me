summary: The website part of the internet.

I've been a little bit obsessed with the internet, and the web particularly, since about 1997. Using AOL to get online and looking at geocities sites was always a wonderous journey into the unknown for 12-year-old-me, and nothing's changed since.

As you can probably tell from this site, I enjoy designing & building websites ‚Äî though I tend to keep my more obscure web experiments away from this blog, so it stays functional. This section of my memex includes websites, features and ideas I really enjoy and might try and replicate or develop with some more of that fabled spare time.
