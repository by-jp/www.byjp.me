# Memex

Taking a cue from personal sites around the web, this memex keeps unformed ideas, links and references around for me to find and use later.

> Memex, a portmanteau of <em>mem</em>ory and <em>ex</em>pansion, is a hypothetical electromechanical device for interacting with documents, described in Vannevar Bush's 1945 article "As We May Think". Bush envisioned the memex as a device which individuals could use as "an enlarged intimate supplement to their memory" and "mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility".
