I've always been a little ashamed of how few languages I speak — even if I can throw a bit of French, Spanish and Japanese around, really its only English I can speak/write with any confidence or capability — compared to many of my friends, my fiancé, and my coworkers all of whom talk to me in their second or third language.

English is wonderful and expressive—I genuinely adore it—but it's so pervasive (my country's colonial past rears its ugly head again) it's very easy to never _need_ to learn any other languages. We're in an odd point in history where that's even feasible, so I like to explore language and the quirks of translation as a way to break out of my linguistic bubble.
