I've enjoyed thinking about this #conlang a lot! I depend a lot on phrasing things precisely to express myself — even in everyday interactions (which can get confusing & frustrating when there's no way anyone else could be aware of the nuance in my word choice…) — so Toki Pona is incredibly interesting.

With only ~120 words and 14 characters it's _tiny_, and forces you to talk around

## alone - a poem

_Quite an intense one! I'm yet to find other pre-translated toki-pona poems. Perhaps I'll try translating one at some point!_

{{< translation "tok" "en" >}}
ijo li moku e mi.\
mi wile pakala.\
pimeja li tawa insa kon mi.\
jan ala li ken sona e pilin ike mi.\
toki musi o, sina jan pona mi wan taso.\
telo pimeja ni li telo loje mi, li ale mi.\
tenpo ale la pimeja li lon.\
wan taso

I am devoured.\
I must destroy.\
Darkness fills my soul.\
No one can understand my suffering.\
O poetry! My only friend.\
This ink is my blood, is my life.\
And Darkness shall reign forevermore.

Someone [wrote code to write (semi-sensical) poetry](https://kevingal.com/blog/toki-poetry.html) in Toki Pona, which looks really fun.

There seem to be a number of fonts that people have created for the _written_ form of toki pona, like [Fairfax HD](https://www.kreativekorp.com/software/fonts/fairfaxhd/) which covers 'all the conlangs in the [registry](https://www.kreativekorp.com/ucsur/)' which will definitely be fun to play with.
