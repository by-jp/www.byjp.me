I've really enjoyed learning the Shavian alphabet! 𐑲'𐑝 𐑮𐑽𐑤𐑰 𐑧𐑯𐑡𐑶𐑛 𐑤𐑻𐑯𐑦𐑙 𐑞 𐑖𐑱𐑝𐑰𐑩𐑯 𐑨𐑤𐑓𐑩𐑚𐑧𐑑!

Because it does away with all the dipthongs and tripthongs of English in the latin [alphabet](/tags/alphabet) it's much shorter (which… is a plus, I guess?) and surprisingly easy to read (once you can recognise the characters).

(For some reason the Shavian alphabet is also a part of [unicode](/tags/unicode), so you can type it too! If you're on a mac, just open the emoji panel with `^ ⌘ space` and type "shavian" to see all the characters)

I created a flashcard pack for [AnkiApp](https://www.ankiapp.com/) (you can [download it here](./flashcards.zip)) and got to being able to read the characters (slowly!) within a week — it's a lot of fun to be able to read what's effectively a secret code 😄
