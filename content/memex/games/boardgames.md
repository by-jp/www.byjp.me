## Sorry!

My Mum & her sister used to play a game called [Sorry!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorry!_(game)) as kids. Mum still has their version of the boardgame, and the design of the board and the cards is enchanting!

{{< figure src="../sorry-outer.webp" alt="The outer box of the Sorry! boargame, with the name in big bold red font from the 60s, embossed on a blue background, on a white and yellow box." title="The copyright is 1951 and 1963, so this is probably a 60s edition. I think it shows in the typography choices.">}}

{{< figure src="../sorry-board.webp" alt="Half of the game board, showing the blue and yellow players&apos; homes of the four-way rotationally symmetric board." title="Each of the four sides has a different season of the same tree beautifully illustrated behind the game." >}}

{{< figure src="../sorry-cards.webp" alt="A wide angle and close-up of the 11 card with text reading &ldquo;Any one of your margin men may change places with any one margin man of any opponent.&rdquo;" title="The font choice and bold single colour design really appeal to me!" >}}
