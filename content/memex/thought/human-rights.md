## Philosophize This!

I really enjoy [this podcast](https://www.philosophizethis.org/) — this part of the memex could probably be called the Philosophize This! section, as most of the thinking-about-thinking I tend to do is off the back of listening to an episode while on a long walk!

## Simone Weil

From [Philosophize This! ep.173](https://www.philosophizethis.org/transcript/episode-173-transcript#:~:text=Simone%20Weil%2C%20quite%20famously%2C%20was%20NOT%20a%20big%20fan%20of%20human%20rights%20discussions); Simone Weil preferred "Human Needs" to "Human Rights". 'Rights' being an imposition of the legal world onto the human. Are your 'rights' to bodily autonomy really only a legal right, or are they instead actually _required_ as a prerequisite of being human (as opposed to dehumanised)?
