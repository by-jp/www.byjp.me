## Spelling

I spell colour with a U (as I'm British) while I'm writing text for humans, but without when I'm writing text for computers (as software languages like #css were created or standardised for American English spelling, `color: red`). This can get confusing when I'm talking about writing code about colours. Weird eh? This was a decision made in the early days of #Deliveroo, and it's kinda stuck with me.

## LCH colours

I'm a big fan of the [LCH colour space](https://css.land/lch/), which is designed to allow for consistent human-perceived luminescence as the hue and chroma change. [Read more here](https://lea.verou.me/blog/2020/04/lch-colors-in-css-what-why-and-how/).
