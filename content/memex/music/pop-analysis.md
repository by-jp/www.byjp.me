## The Girl from Ipanema

Adam Neely is always brilliant to listen to, but [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFWCbGzxofU) about "the second most recorded song in human history", The Girl from Ipanema, is incredibly interesting! Dive in and see what you think!

I got to listen to a lot of Bossa Nova while I was in Brasil earlier this year, I wish I could have listened to more!
