I love making things. Recently bought a mini book at the Tate in Liverpool called [Art is the thing nobody asked you to do](https://roughtradebooks.com/products/art-is-the-thing-nobody-asked-you-to-do-babak-ganjei), and without even picking it up I felt a connection with that description of art. I _do_ love creating things, but often its the unnecessary things, the expressive and intriguing ones, that I enjoy the most.

I look forward to reading that book, and to this section of the memex growing quickly!
