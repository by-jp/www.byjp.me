Not really a web comic, but always funny; b3ta is a very British culture centric comedy forum, with regular image posts constructed by the members to give some very dry wit to British news and references. The posts that make it to this feed almost always get a `sensible_chuckle.gif` out of me, and I've often come across major (inter)national news from its members' sarcastic takes before anywhere else!
