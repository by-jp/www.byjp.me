IPFS is one of my favouriote web technologies for the future: a mechanism for sharing data (especially static websites, at the moment) from _person to person_ in a trustworthy way, instead of always from corporate-run server to person.

Their blog is a good read if you're interested in the technolgy behind it; even if it is a litte 'hard sell' advocacy on the technology at the moment, that's where they need to be as a group right now and I support it!

By the way, this site is eternally available over IPFS at `/ipns/www.byjp.me`, if you have a browser that supports it, or the inclination to browse throw a public gateway (like [www-byjp-me.ipns.dweb.link](https://www-byjp-me.ipns.dweb.link/)).
