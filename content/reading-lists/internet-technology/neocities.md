It doesn't get a lot of activity these days, but Neocities has long been a fascinating company working to bring back the creativity of the early world wide web. Their name is even a reference to the _enormously_ popular early web-page hosting company [Geocities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities) â€” later bought and shut down by _Yahoo!_.

Do read their blog if you're interested in making a home on the web, and take a browse through [the sites they host](https://neocities.org/browse), there are _a lot_!
