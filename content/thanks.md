Human connection is really important to me and, in that way and others, on this site and elsewhere, I try to act to leave the world better off than when I arrived.

It's extremely nice to know when I've achieved that, but it means _even more_ to me when people "pay it forward". If you've appreciated anything on this site, or anything else I've done or made, you'd humble me by sharing your time, effort, money, privilege, or kindness with anyone you feel deserves it.

Though money is the least of the valuable things I mentioned above, it can make a real difference in many places. If my efforts inspire you to donate money to any cause you feel is worthy, you can register that donation below to let me know.
