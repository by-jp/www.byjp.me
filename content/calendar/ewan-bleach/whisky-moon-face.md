Hidden behind a secret entrance on Charing Cross Road, Larryâ€™s is our brand-new underground cocktail bar located in the historic vaults of the National Portrait Gallery. Originally built as coal storage in 1896, the spectacular exposed brick space has been transformed offering a slice of elegance deep into the evening (seven days a week), just a short stroll from Covent Garden and Trafalgar Square. Sip on classic cocktails and dine on lavish bar snacks, amidst over 100 portraits of the famous faces of Londonâ€™s West End.
