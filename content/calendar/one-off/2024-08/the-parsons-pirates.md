summary: The funniest production of Gilbert & Sullivanâ€™s The Pirates of Penzance youâ€™ll ever see.

I'm taking Yvette to see some Gilbert & Sullivan! I've always enjoyed going to Wilton's (and, as a swing dancer I've been lucky enough to go many times), though I've not been for a musical yet, I'm looking forward to it!

> Opera della Luna return to Wiltonâ€™s to celebrate the companyâ€™s 30th Anniversary by re-staging its first big success. This hilarious and ingenious production of Pirates gained the company national recognition and over the years has played in over 200 venues in all parts of the UK and Ireland, but this is its first production in London.
