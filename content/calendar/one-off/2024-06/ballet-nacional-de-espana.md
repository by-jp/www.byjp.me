I'm writing up this event after the fact as I'd forgotten {{< friend yvette >}} has booked for us to go ‚Äî I'll keep my thoughts on it for another post but you should definitely go to see this while it's in town!

> Invocaci√≥n features four works that cover the cornerstones of Spanish dance, from vibrant flamenco (De lo Flamenco) and traditional bolero (Invocaci√≥n Bolera) to contemporary dance (Jaule√±a) and classical ballet (Eterna Iberia).
>
> As one of the main cultural ambassadors of Spain to the world, Ballet Nacional de Espa√±a (BNE) highlight Spain‚Äôs rich choreographic heritage. The National Ballet, founded by the Ministry of Culture in 1978, continues to set the standard for Spanish dance.
>
> Artistic Director Rub√©n Olmo curates this all-encompassing evening of four pieces. De lo Flamenco is a tribute to the legendary dancer and choreographer Mario Maya. Olmo choreographs two works; Jaule√±a, performed by a different soloist from the company each night, and the colourful, ensemble piece, Invocaci√≥n Bolera. Finally Antonio Najarro‚Äôs Eterna Iberia which features the signature elements of Spanish dance ‚Äì castanets, the Spanish Cape, and the Cordobes Hat.
