I so thoroughly enjoyed my few weeks in Brazil last year, there was art _everywhere_ and I'm so excited to learn a little more about the ideas that built the artistic scene I got glimpses into.

I'm planning on visiting on the Tuesday, but this exhibition is on from 7th March through to 5th May, so shout if you'd like to go with me and I'll be happy to shuffle it about!

> A rich diversity of artistic approaches existed in Brazil in the decades around the mid-twentieth century, after the first modernist wave had settled. This exhibition finds conversations between various forms of abstraction, symbolism and figuration that were circulating and interacting in the visual culture of that time. The abstract geometries produced by the concretists and neo-concretists in SÃ£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro â€“ Judith Lauand, Lygia Clark, HÃ©lio Oiticica and Lygia Pape amongst them â€“ are now internationally celebrated. The Afro-Brazilian symbology developed in the same period by artists such as Mestre Didi, Abdias Nascimento and Rubem Valentim, often referring to CandomblÃ© and other spiritual practices, was no less pioneering. Also brought into dialogue are depictions of street scenes, domestic life and agricultural labour â€“ perennially popular genres in Brazilian art, which are elaborated in the compositions of Silvia de Leon Chalreo, the theatrical stagings of Heitor dos Prazeres, and the expressive textiles of Madalena Santos Reinbolt.
