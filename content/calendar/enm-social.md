summary: A social event for the ethically non-monogamous community, for making friends.
---

A very friendly bunch of people from the broad ENM (ethical non-monogamy) community â€” I love going to these events, even though I don't have (m?)any friends there. It's a long way from home for me, so it never worked so well with work the following day, but that's not a problem any more, so I go when I'm in town!

> We'll be gathering at the Fox and Firkin pub in SE London for a lovely evening socialising with fellow ENM folks. This event takes place both indoors and in the beer garden, so you can socialise however you like.
>
> Our events are about celebrating the diversity of our community, making friends, building support networks and sharing educational resources. If you are polyamorous, ethically non-monogamous, in an open relationship or have just started exploring ENM, we would love for you to join us!
>
> IMPORTANT: **You must read our [code of conduct](https://www.canva.com/design/DAE10LTpHzw/uyk7eXEeyXEauAMY8F-BzA/view) before attending.
