I'm really looking forward to my first Swing festival since the pandemic! I'm heading there with {{< friend becky >}} but I know my cousin & her partner are going too â€” will I see you there?

> Swing North is thrilled to invite you to our first ever weekend in Manchester, at the end of August. Weâ€™re buzzing like bees (the symbol of Manchester) to share with you some of our favourite musicians, and a choice of classes that you can pick and mix, to suit your level and taste.
