My wife and a friend of ours are both keen to learn to swing dance, so we're all going to the beginner Bermondsey Swing Patrol classes on Wednesday nights.

I've been dancing lindy hop (and other forms of swing) for probably the last 12 years (I'm no "beginner"), but I've spent almost all of that time leading, so I'm going to try my hand (and feet) at unlearning everything I know and instead try to follow.

Do come and join us if you'd like to learn to dance too!

> Join Jessy and Will for a lesson or two in Swing Dancing, a collection of dances from the 1920s-1940s including Lindy hop and Charleston.
