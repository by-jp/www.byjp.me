A last minute afternoon visit with Karol.

> **A British artist's brash and tender exploration of what makes us human**
>
> Sarah Lucas is internationally celebrated for her bold and provocative use of materials and imagery.
>
> Using ordinary objects in unexpected ways, she has consistently challenged our understanding of sex, class and gender over the last four decades.
>
> This exhibition presents her practice in all its diversity across sculpture, installation and photography, narrated in her voice, and looking well beyond the 1990s Young British Art world.
>
> Breaking boundaries with humour and daring, Lucas shows us the whole spectrum of what it means to be human.
