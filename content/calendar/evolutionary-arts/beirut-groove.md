I might get tickets to go for a groovy clubnight in Hackney â€” send a message if you'd be keen too!

> The original contemporary late night event. Friday Late celebrates all aspects of contemporary visual culture and design in society, bringing audiences together with leading and emerging artists and designers through live performance, film, installation, debate, DJs and more.

> Now celebrating its 15th year, the Beirut Groove Collective is a collective of vinyl DJs, crate diggers, music obsessives and artists. For over a decade, the BGC has thrown one of the SWANA regionâ€™s most popular underground clubnights in Beirut, the BGC All-Nighter, which has built an international reputation for its distinctive sound and attracted some of the world's leading DJs, turntabalists and record collectors. In 2021, the collective brought their club nights to London with sell-out monthly residencies in grassroots venues across the city, as well as guest appearances at festivals, clubs and community spaces around the world.

> At their parties, the BGC plays obscure and underground clubbing records from the â€˜60s-â€˜80s from the Arab world, Africa and beyond, an eclectic mix of Lebanese â€˜60s psych and Beat, oriental jazz, belly dance disco Arabic pop, Dabkeh, Armenian Estradayin, Ethiopian Bangers and Sudanese Jazz and much more.
