If I'm not hosting folks to see the fireworks from our balcony (and/or have a "oh no its so dark so early" evening of drinking) then I'll be going here to see these lovely speakers.

> In Nicer Tuesdaysâ€™ penultimate event of 2024, we dive into innovative typography, documentary photography and wild, technicolour motion design.
>
> Why not stay creatively cosy this bonfire night? At Novemberâ€™s Nicer Tuesdays â€“ the penultimate event of 2024 â€“ weâ€™re incredibly excited to be hosting three remarkable speakers: Dinamo, Emmanuel Cole and Rose Pilkington. From the mundanity and chaos of Londoners to Glastonbury-starring, electrifying 3D visuals for Romy, via pioneering typographic design, there is undoubtedly a breadth of creative expression to get stuck into.
