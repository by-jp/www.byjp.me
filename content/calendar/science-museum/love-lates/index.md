I've always enjoyed the Science Museum, and their lates particularly! I'll definitely be going, and maybe I'll see you there!

> This March, join us at Lates for a journey to unravel the essence of love.
>
> From the intimate bonds of friendship to the pursuit of passions and pleasure, we navigate the landscape of human connection like never before.
>
> What does the latest neuroscience tell us about the strongest human emotion? Has increased digital interaction changed how we express affection? As more of us identify as LGBTQ+, how has the queer experience transformed our understanding of love?
>
> Join us at Lates to explore the latest dating and sex tech, as well as the future of family units and the power of pheromones, Plus, enjoy regular Lates activities including our iconic silent disco and your chance to see our galleries after hours.
