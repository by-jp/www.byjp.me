I'd really love to go to EMF Camp this year (it'd be my first time, despite how much I'm sure I'd like it!) but I think I'd need to offer to volunteer to get tickets, and this close to my wedding might be a bit too much at once!

> Electromagnetic Field is a non-profit camping festival for those with an inquisitive mind or an interest in making things: hackers, artists, geeks, crafters, scientists, and engineers.
>
> A temporary town of nearly three thousand like-minded people enjoying a long weekend of talks, performances, and workshops on everything from blacksmithing to biometrics, chiptunes to computer security, high altitude ballooning to lockpicking, origami to democracy, and online privacy to knitting.
>
> To help matters along, we provide fast internet, power to the tent, good beer, and amazing installations, entirely organised by a dedicated team of volunteers.
