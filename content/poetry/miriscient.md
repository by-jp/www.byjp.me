Morning always brought about a sigh of resignation for me.\
A feeling of incompatibility\
Between the world inside my dreaming head\
And the one I found before me.

So I'd turn the other cheek\
And maybe sneak another forty winks\
As I tried to burrow back beneath the sheets\
And strain to make those two ends meet.

But there's only so much you can do from bed.\
Locked into reflection, sometimes it's novelty\
That spurs on perception, so instead\
I made a choice: to look ahead and take wonder as my voice.

Turns out, shock horror, I'm nothing new\
There's quite a few folks who take the view\
That shaping oddities from in your mind\
And bringing them alive is what we're _meant_ to do

So now I strive to learn as much\
About the wondrous, and absurd, and such\
As is plainly, humanly, possible.

To be in awe of what my fellow dreamers make,\
Of their dreams or with their hands when wide awake\
Is the _greatest_ existential vent\
I thrive on being miriscient.
