Shattered panes of understanding\
This is not how things should be!\
Self comprehension denied at once\
Why try my hand at this?

For days and days I've been so sure,\
Chemistry a simple slave,\
Yet intellect provides no cure\
When impulse be my bride.

Come seven hours or twenty minutes\
(Confused minds know half as much)\
My tongue shall speak a different name\
And pray not know the change.
