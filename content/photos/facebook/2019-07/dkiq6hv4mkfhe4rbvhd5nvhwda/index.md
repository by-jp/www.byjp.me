{{% importnote 2024-04-05 %}}
This being an import of a Facebook post, I also wrote a slightly longer post about this project [here on this blog](/posts/the-beauty-of-type/).
{{%/ importnote %}}

A few weeks back, while recovering from a nasty cold, I was inspired by a beautiful postcard my friend Richard sent. It displayed an alphabet he created, each letter inspired by a different writing system of the world.

It made me want to learn about making typefaces, and to build something that would honour Richard's creation as well as my slight bedridden delirium…

I made a font I called Caspian, which I used to send him a couple of artsy postcards, and a website which typed the lyrics of the songs I listened to while in bed, it does this in time with the very same music. It's eery and beautiful (in my mind, at least!)

My website skill is somewhat less developed than it used to be (focusing as I do on the server-side at work), so the website will likely not work for you outside of a desktop Chrome browser, but do give it a try at https://caspian.byjp.me — the video below shows a snippet from the middle of one track :) What an awesome script Richard created, eh?
