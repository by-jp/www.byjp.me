Been geeking it up tonight, building the hardware for [Chris](/tags/chris)' latest project: Sunrise, a Nixie tube display alarm clock \(those epic Russian number things on the right\) which slowly dials up your Phillips Hue lights & plays you 1920s swing in the mornings.



Now I have to build the software \(and hope I've wired that rotary encoder properly\!\) - it'll tax my Elixir & Nerves skills for sure\!
