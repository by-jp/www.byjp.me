What a stunning view we have from our bedroom! We’re staying in Yvette’s late Aunt’s home in the part of Caracas called _La Florida_ — it’s absolutely stunning! Her home is beautiful (and probably the most incredibly designed home I’ve ever been in — both architecturally and furnishings), and this gorgeous backdrop of Caracas is verdant beyond anything I could have imagined!
