Diving

[PostcardsForLucy](/tags/postcardsforlucy)



Rosa can't decide which moment is her favourite. Maybe the joy of diving is falling in love with each of them again every time she leaps:



1. The timeless instant of stillness right after jumping — the void between her feeble attempt to defeat gravity and the start of…



2. The fall, all-encompassing weightlessness; complete freedom and utter submission blurring into one



3. That total envelopment, her streamlined form needling beneath the waves, immemorable and shocking.



Giddy, Rosa steps forwards, and takes a breath.
