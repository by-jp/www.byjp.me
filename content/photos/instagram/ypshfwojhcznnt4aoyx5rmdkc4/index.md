Serenity

[PostcardsForLucy](/tags/postcardsforlucy)



Freshly painted and lovingly varnished, the little dinghy Serenity sits high & proud in the harbour, the water so clear and still she's beautiful twice.



The faintest of breezes sways everything, the boats' lethargic tilting drumming out a simple rhythm between their masts and rigging, marking time on this endless afternoon.



Serenity rocks too, distorting and illuminating the seabed scar where concrete dock meets pebbled bay. She rocks like she did yesterday, never to be sailed again.
