A beautiful piece of old to go with the all the new!



My Dad started his antiques business a month before I was born, in May 1985. The change—a move out of London, a career he had a passion for, and more control over—was a big part of how my parents prepared for my arrival.



His shop \(Quiet Street Antiques, in Bath) is definitely one of my favourite places on earth, not least because of its timelessness: filled with a symphony of Georgian clocks of all types, marking the seconds in the same way they've done for a quarter of a millenium.



To celebrate this unusual twinship I have, and I think in many ways to mark my Dad's retirement later this year \(aged 75!), he gave me this unbelievably brautiful so-called skeleton clock — it is absolutely stunning; I couldn't be more appreciative and thrilled!
