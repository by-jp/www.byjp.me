Yesterday we visited Alcatraz; it was extremely good, not at all the tourist trap I was somewhat expecting!



The audio tour was superb, and we were even given a secret, exclusive tour of the hospital wing \(we saw both "Birdman" and Capone's isolates cells, and one of the rooms used in filming The Rock, ceiling still replete with fake blood spatter ðŸ˜…



This photo is of the emblem above the administrative wing's entrance, the red & white representing the US  augmented by the native Indians who claimed ownership of the land and lived there for nearly two years after it closed. I really like what it became ðŸ˜Š
