Earlier today a friend offered us some tickets to Gingerline's [The Grand Expedition](https://www.gingerline.co.uk/) they couldn't use, which — apart from being _insanely_ kind — was exactly the break the two of us needed from a busy week!

The food was wonderful, the theatrical antics fun & inspiring, and the people we got to chat with were just lovely. What a night!
