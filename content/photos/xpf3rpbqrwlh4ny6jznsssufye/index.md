Twos

[PostcardsForLucy](/tags/postcardsforlucy)



TRAVELLING CELLISTS: young & talented, bright eyed & happily struggling with their instruments.



SLOW MINUTES: delighting in smooth mango yoghurt, watching Paddington bustle on.



BABIES' BOTTOMS: soft & clean after loving parents' attention.



ZEN-LIKE TRAIN RIDES: a speeding bubble shooting through the greenery.



GUJARATI SAMOSA: when peckish, impeccably delectable.



GLASSES OF GRAPEFRUIT WINE: home brewed & with a sprig of mint, refreshing, sunlight lazing through their ice cubes.



TIMES THROUGH: Musing to The Resistance, enjoying what my ears give me.



BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE: who made a third, and introduced me to her.
