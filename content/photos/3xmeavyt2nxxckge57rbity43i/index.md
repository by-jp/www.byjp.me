I continue to enjoy reading Atkins & Johnson's "A Dodo at Oxford"; it is at least as whimsical and enjoyable as the reviews make it out to be — definitely one for those with a curious mind and miriscient soul\!



This section is about some cards left inside the antique diary which is the subject of the book; do get yourself a copy, or borrow mine when I'm done\! http://www.oxgarth.co.uk/a-dodo-at-oxford.html
