[PostcardsForLucy](/tags/postcardsforlucy)



Over Christmas in 2017 I found an old box stored in the loft at my Mum's house



Inside, amongst baby photos and first shoes, was a bundle of postcards collected by my late Grandmother, Lucy.



In the 1950s she travelled Europe with her friends through France, Germany, Austria and Switzerland.



Taking photographs wasn't so simple back then so, instead, she collected a postcard from each place she visited.



I knew I wanted to tell the story of Lucy's journey but, sadly, I missed my opportunity to ask her about her youth.



I realised that I still wanted to create something with these mementos; something to tell the story of the journey, even if I couldn't tell her's;



So, since the beginning of 2018, I've enjoyed writing short stories on these postcards — inspired by where Lucy found them — and sending them to family and friends. I'm collected them here, I hope you enjoy them too.
