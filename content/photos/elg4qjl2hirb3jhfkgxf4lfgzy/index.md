5 years ago today I joined my Dad in the Serengeti National Park for part of his four month cross-Africa adventure and had almost unforgettable birthday.



From waking before dawn to see the wildebeest migrating to sitting still enough, binoculours to face, to see wildlife return around us we trekked as far as we could to see some of the most beautiful creatures on earth.



My Dad gave me the T-Shirt you can see in the last pic; "Mzungu" is a Bantu word, it generally refers to European folk, or people who speak English, but its original meaning is better translated as "wanderer". Presumably they were so in shock at the beauty of this part of the world \(or so inept at dealing with its dangers\), that it came to change its meaning. Time to do some more wandering I think ðŸ˜Š
