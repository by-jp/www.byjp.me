I'm missing my late Mum especially today. It's the first anniversary of her death, and to remember her we went to one of her favourite places: [Westonbirt Arboretum](https://www.forestryengland.uk/westonbirt-the-national-arboretum).

I was very happy when my Aunt (Mum's twin sister) agreed to join my wife & I for the day; her love of trees parallels my Mum's, so we enjoyed a long afternoon of walking through the _glorious_ forests, and in particular the [Acer glade](https://www.forestryengland.uk/westonbirt/national-collections).

The time of year was _perfect_ for our visit, with the (world famous!) collection of Japanese Acer trees going every shade of orange and red.

I've spent _literally_ my entire life visiting this beautiful place with my Mum (my parents brought me home from the hospital to our home adjacent to this very arboretum), and I hope I'll be able to visit here for many years to come, not least to be with her.
