I just installed a [Sensor Watch](https://sensorwatch.net) movement in my old Casio watch! (It's the green board on the right there.)

I'm having a lot of fun with the new modes my watch has; notably, a [.beat time](/posts/uncommon-time-telling/#swatch-internet-time-beat-time) face, a world clock (to show my brother's time in Vancouver), a thermometer readout (!), a days-until timer (44 days until my wedding!), and a whole bunch more.

I feel like this will fit nicely with [EMFCamp](/tags/emfcamp)'s solarpunk theme!
