Josh in Köln

[postcardsforlucy](/tags/postcardsforlucy)



Josh planned to walk the Rhine.



He dreamed of long, summery strolls through the little villages & towns on the way to Mainz; the delicious wines that surely would still be cheap after last year's glorious weather.



There was something incredibly alluring to him about going such a long way under his own power — a freedom from the pressures of constant contact with his family, friends and colleagues that lifted his mood every time he thought about it.



Josh stared aimlessly at the thousands of padlocks on the fences as he crossed the Hohenzollen.



He'd talk to his boss tomorrow about a long break. Yes, tomorrow.
