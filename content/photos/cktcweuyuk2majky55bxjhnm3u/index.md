Come on a journey around El Teide National Park with us\!



The climb up Volcano Teide was tricky and breath taking, in all the ways. Even though we started from the cable car getting the final 700m to 3,715m above sea level it was tough enough to keep Yvette from the peak — but that didn't stop our adventuring\!



We took to Volcano Samara just as the sun was setting, and enjoyed a beautiful walk through the Canarian pine forest gazing down on the clouds, spying Las Palmas and other Canary Islands peaking above the glowing candy floss.



Enjoying car-cuddles as the stars emerged, we stole a glorious view of Jupiter, Saturn and a supremely elegant crescent moon before winding our way home to Vilaflor and the soundest of nights' sleep.



Come to Tenerife folks, enjoy Teide, it's *wonderful*.
