Yvette took me to see Guys & Dolls for date night! (Yes, date night comes more frequently than once every four years ðŸ˜‚)

We were _in_ the stage, with parts of the floor mechanically raising and lowering to create the parts the main characters were standing on ("immersive" seats). It was surprisingly fun to be right amidst it; having to re-negotiate your viewpoint with neighbours inbetween scenes just wasn't a problem!
