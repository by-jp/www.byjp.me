It's been just over a week since Yvette and I were married ü•∞ We're now back home after our honeymoon, and still floating high on the food and drink and dancing and love of our friends and family!

Our photographer still needs time to prepare our photos from the day, but our friend Jo√£o snapped this gorgeous pic while we were making our way "down the aisle" and I love it ‚ù§Ô∏è
