A musical hero of mine released a new version of a song I love today; which I think, for a few more hours, gets to be called "I Like you Best of All (I Like Pi)" üòÅ

Lindy Hoppers will recognise it by name instantly, but whether you know it or not I urge you to listen to this version then have a read of the context Gordon gives to it.

I'd love to hear your thoughts if you're up for sharing!
