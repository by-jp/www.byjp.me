Thank you so much! It makes me _enormously_ happy that you're appreciating my work, and doubly so that you're willing to share what you have with others on my behalf.

Money can set up some very strange incentives in humans, but donating to a charity, supporting a person who inspires you, investing in your community, and so many other acts of openness bring us closer together — for me, the entire point of all this.

If you'd like to tell me about the person, group or cause that you contrinuted to on my behalf I'd [love to hear about it](/standing-invitation/)!

_By the way, the counter on the [thanks page](/thanks/) can take a few minutes to update!_
