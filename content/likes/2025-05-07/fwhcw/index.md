        <p>If you want to keep eggs warm to hatch, you’ll need an incubator. You could buy one off the shelf, but they’re not so complex — just a nicely-controlled warm box you could easily whip up yourself. As it turns out, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfRLMU6guQQ" target="_blank">that’s precisely what [RCLifeOn] did.&nbsp;</a></p>
        <p>The incubator is built out of wooden panels screwed together to make a simple box. The frame of the front door is also wood, but it features 3D printed hinges and handles, because that’s the easiest way to make hardware <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/11/14/5-kilowatts-in-a-3d-printed-jet-boat/">when you’re a printing wizard like [RCLifeOn].</a></p>
        <p>The box is fitted with controls for humidity and temperature to ensure the best possible conditions for hatching chicken eggs inside. As you might have guessed, a heated bed from a 3D printer was used to control the temperature inside. As for humidity, a sensor tracks the conditions in the box, and triggers an ultrasonic mister to increase the level as necessary. There’s also a little motion introduced via a moving platform run by a motor and some step-down gearing, which apparently aids in the hatching process.</p>
        <p>[RCLifeOn] calls it “a machine that creates life,” and that honestly sounds about fair. <a href="https://hackaday.com/2016/03/28/start-your-poultry-brood-with-this-diy-egg-incubator/">We’ve seen similar projects along these lines before, too.</a></p>
