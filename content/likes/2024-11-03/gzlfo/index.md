    name: The Telephone Box | Kiosk No 2
    summary: The K2 kiosk was Britain's first red Telephone Box. It was the winning design from a 1924 competition to find the design for a national kiosk. Designed by British architect Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, the K2 was introduced in 1926 and over the next nine years some 1,700 examples were installed mostly in London. The design of the K2 features many influences of classical architecture. Just over 200 examples remain on British streets and these are given Grade II listing status by English Heritage.
