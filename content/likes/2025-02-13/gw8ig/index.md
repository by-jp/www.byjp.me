    name: "EffVer: Version your code by the effort required to upgrade"
    summary: Version numbers are hard to get right. Semantic Versioning (SemVer) communicates backward compatibility via version numbers which often lead to a false sense of security and broken promises. Calendar Versioning (CalVer) sits at the other extreme of communicating almost no useful information at all.

Gosh, I don't know that I want to be a person that has a favourite versioning scheme, but I might be with this one!
