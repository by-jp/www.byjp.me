Things I might work on within my personal blog's software.

### Bugs

- [ ] Fix val.town donations link ([deprecation notice](https://docs.val.town/api/run/))
- [ ] Now page isn't current
- [ ] Micropub Replies look weird in a bunch of places
  - [ ] When posted via Echofeed: They include the "in reply to" initial stuff; this is too cumbersome
  - [ ] When posted via Echofeed: They should probably be "Quiet public", or ideally posted as replies to a fedi post, if there's one referenced in the source as a syncidcation
  - [x] They get posted on the homepage, when they shouldn't

### Ideas

- [ ] Show (internal) replies to this note
- [ ] Import from Omnivore daily  
- [ ] Record & display cross-links within site?
- [ ] Customise IndieKit
  - [ ] Add tags from #hashtags
  - [ ] Add links to memex from Â§refs
- [ ] Switch Memex to single file (easier to post to)
- [ ] Remove http://gowal.la & https://4sq.com links and/or posts that are useless without them
- [ ] Automate Gemini deploy
- [ ] Fix `mention-of` imports tools/import/webmentionio/main.go:172
- [ ] Move to referenced SVGs in header, rather than inline â€” they take up 4kb on every ~16-20kb page ðŸ˜±

### Working

- [ ] Remove lychee failing links
- [ ] Import Facebook posts
