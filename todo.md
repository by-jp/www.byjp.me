Things I might work on within my personal blog's software.

### Bugs

### Ideas

- [ ] Record new webmentions on publish
- [ ] Record & display cross-links within site?

  - [ ] Add tags from #hashtags
  - [ ] Add links to memex from §refs
- [ ] Switch Memex to single file (easier to post to)
- [ ] Remove http://gowal.la & https://4sq.com links and/or posts that are useless without them
- [ ] Gemini?!
  - [x] Tags pages
