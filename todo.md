Things I might work on within my personal blog's software.

### Bugs

- [ ] Fix val.town donations link ([deprecation notice](https://docs.val.town/api/run/))
- [ ] Now page isn't current
- [ ] Videos in "photos" don't have a thumbnail, and don't work in the list.

### Ideas

- [ ] Add `inReplyTo` support (like bookmarks)
- [ ] Complete Twitter import  
  - [ ] Figure out missing multi-photo tweets (eg. 1031265304675053568)  
  - [ ] Remove reply tweets with no parent (the one to mhudack is a good example)  
  - [x] Fix hashtags with poor accessibility multiwordhashtags  
  - [x] Fix goodreads links (point to blog)  
  - [x] Fix instagram links (~~point to blog~~ delete; they're cross-posts anyway)  
  - [ ] Show (internal) replies to this note
- [ ] Import from Omnivore daily  
- [ ] Facebook import?
- [ ] Record new webmentions on publish
- [ ] Record & display cross-links within site?
- [ ] Customise IndieKit
  - [ ] Add tags from #hashtags
  - [ ] Add links to memex from §refs
- [ ] Switch Memex to single file (easier to post to)

### Working

- [ ] Remove lychee failing links

### Done ✓

- [x] Add Links to Bookmarks & Notes
